# The Fun Facts Randomizer

### Description
This project was created as a part of the JavaScript class to learn and practice Math.floor() and Math.random() methods.

## Available options

Enjoy funny facts provided to you in a random order just by clickin one button! Have fun!

## Technologies Used

<ul>
   <li>HTML5</li>
   <li>CSS3</li>
   <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

## Setup/Installation Requirements

<ul>
   <li>Clone the repo: https://github.com/Angiedoescoding/funfacts-mathfloor-mathrandom.git</li>
   <li>Run npm start. This should open 'localhost:3000' in your browser.</li>
</ul>

## How To Build Criteria

<ol>
  <li>Use Math.random() method for the app to generate a random number between 0 and the one you need depending on how many fact you will add into your code output.</li>
  <li>Remember that Math.random() method returns a pseudo-random numbergeneration algorithm and will show the fact that is added to that specific number of the back-end.</li>
  <li>The user shouldk be unable to choose the number. Only computer generates the number (aka the fact).</li>
  <li>Since the system can generate a random number, it can decide to choose other than an integer number. You need to use a Math.floor() method to make the code to only use integers numbers.</li>
</ol>
